It is important to understand little bit about getting help and running into a problem
When face an error first step is Tinker.
Tinker can refer to the act of experimenting, making small changes, or exploring code to understand how it works or to find a solution to a problem.
Limit tinker upto 20 minutes or 15 minutes and for that we need to be 100 percent sure that we ahve tried all steps and now we are out of ideas<br>
then we can move to the next step <br>

Next step is to google the exact error<br>

Another step is shown in the picture below:

Figure1: going to this link https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js/discussions
and ask for any problamatic question

Also we can ask question at Stack Overflow and Ethereum Stack Exchange<br>

Stack overflow is for general programming question and Ethereum Stack Excahnge is for ethereum based question <br>
and all the solidity code that we gonna be working with<br>

### How to debug anything

Figure4: Before asking question. here search means at first do web search to save yours and others time <br>

Add a minimalistic code means not to copy paste the entire code if problem with one line just give that line 

Reproducible code means writing code in a way that allows anyone, including yourself in the future, to easily run the code and obtain the same results

### Installation and setup (Moving to local development)

Wihtout Internet connection we can't work with Remix.

```Hardhat``` is a professional smart contract developer setup. it is also known as smart contract developer framework <br>
just like Brownie, Foundry <br>

```Hardhat``` is ```Javascript``` based <br>

Figure7: Features of Hardhat <br>

```Ether.Js``` is a javascript based library for working with smart contracts <br>

There is a lot of ether.js under ```Hardhat``` <br>

It is important for us to learn ether.js to understand what actually ```hardhat``` is doing <br>

at first we have to install code editor known as VS code or visual studio code. <br>

then we yhave to install Node.js in the following way:

![e9](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Ether.Js1/assets/89090776/de8b2b6e-0183-4d23-b2d0-65b5ac2e811b)

Figure8: going to google we have to search and go this link <br>

Node.js is going to help to run our Javascript code for our development environment <br>
