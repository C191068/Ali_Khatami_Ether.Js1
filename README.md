It is important to understand little bit about getting help and running into a problem
When face an error first step is Tinker.
Tinker can refer to the act of experimenting, making small changes, or exploring code to understand how it works or to find a solution to a problem.
Limit tinker upto 20 minutes or 15 minutes and for that we need to be 100 percent sure that we ahve tried all steps and now we are out of ideas<br>
then we can move to the next step <br>

Next step is to google the exact error<br>

Another step is shown in the picture below:
